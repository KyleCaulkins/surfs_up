# Surfs_Up

## Overview

This analysis is part of a broader project, starting a surf and shake shop on the island of O'ahu, Hawaii. A key investor to the surf and shake shop, W. Avy, is concerned about the weather on O'ahu. Specifically, W. Avy is requesting temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. The months of June and December are of interest because these two months will indicate if the surf and shake shop is a sustainable year-round business. The following analysis represents the findings from W. Avy's request.

## Results

The following is a list of three significant findings from analyzing the weather data for O'ahu, Hawaii in the months of June and December. Detail of the code used for this analysis can be found

The minimum, maximum and mean temperatures for the months of June and December are of particular importance in this weather analysis. Below are the results from the analysis, with min, max, and mean temperatures highlighted. The month of June has a mean temp of 74.9 degrees, min temp of 64.0 degrees, and a max temp of 85.0 degrees. The month of December has a mean temperature of 71.0 degrees, a min temp of 56.0 and a max temp of 83.0 degrees.
