# Surfs_Up

## Overview

This analysis is part of a broader project of starting a surf and shake shop on the island of O'ahu, Hawaii. A key investor to the surf and shake shop, W. Avy, is concerned about the weather on O'ahu. Specifically, W. Avy is requesting temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. The months of June and December are of interest because these two months will indicate if the surf and shake shop is a sustainable year-round business. The following analysis represents the findings from W. Avy's request.

## Results

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
